# Cloud-Native Production Environment Architecture

## Central Platform:
- **Kubernetes Cluster**: Orchestrates containers and manages workloads.

## Key Components:
- **Backstage**: Developer portal providing software catalog, CI/CD integration, documentation, and monitoring dashboards.
- **Harbor**: Private container registry to manage container images securely.
- **Cilium**: Provides networking, security policies, observability using eBPF technology.
- **Cert-manager**: Automates the issuance and renewal of TLS certificates.
- **Keycloak**: Identity and access management system providing authentication and authorization.
- **Argo Suite**:
  - **Argo CD**: GitOps continuous deployment tool.
  - **Argo Workflows**: Workflow orchestration and CI pipelines.
  - **Argo Events/Rollouts**: Event-driven workflows and canary deployments.
- **Prometheus**: Monitoring and alerting toolkit.
- **Loki**: Log aggregation system for collecting and managing logs.

## Integration and Interactions:
- **Backstage** interacts with all components, providing a unified view for developers and administrators.
- **Harbor** is integrated with Kubernetes and Keycloak for secure image management.
- **Cilium** manages cluster networking, providing observability data to Prometheus.
- **Cert-manager** integrates with Kubernetes and Keycloak for automated certificate management.
- **Keycloak** provides centralized authentication services for Kubernetes, Backstage, Harbor, and Argo Suite.
- **Argo Suite** integrates with Kubernetes and Git repositories for streamlined deployments and CI/CD processes.
- **Prometheus** gathers metrics from all components, with dashboards presented via Backstage.
- **Loki** aggregates logs from Kubernetes and applications, accessible via dashboards.

This architecture ensures scalability, security, observability, and ease of use for cloud-native application deployment and management.
